Don\u0027t know if you have explored this yet for Functest, but it starts the container over, effectively getting rid of all the alpine-sdk and other transient packages that are not needed at runtime.  I then \"COPY --from\" later to pull the built FIO forward and drop all the gcc, etc, used to build it.  Might make Functest even smaller?",
