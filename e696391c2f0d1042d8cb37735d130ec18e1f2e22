      "message": "The problem with downloading the RC file from Horizon is that you need the user name and password, along with the project.  At this point, you almost have everything needed to create the file.  It\u0027s a bit of a chicken and egg problem.\n\nAlso, the RC file that is downloaded is actually a script that prompts you to enter your password.  It doesn\u0027t keep a copy of it.\n\nOverall good food for thought.",
